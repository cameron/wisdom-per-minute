It is plain that to make the postulate of objectivity a condition for true knowledge constitutes an ethical choice and not a knowledge judgement inasmuch as according to the postulate itself, there can be no "true" knowledge before this arbitrary choice. The postulate of objectivity, in order to establish a norm for knowledge, defines a value which is objective knowldge itself. To accept the positulate of objectivity then is to articulate the basic proposition of an ethics: the ethics of knowledge.
